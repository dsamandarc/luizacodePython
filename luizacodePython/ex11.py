# 11)This program will calculate the area of a square. 
# Ask the person to enter the numerical measurement of one side of the square. 
# AND then tell it the value of the area of the square.
side_of_square = input(f'Enter the side of square in cm:')
area_of_square = float(side_of_square)*float(side_of_square)
print(f'The area of the square is:', area_of_square)
#return: Enter the side of square in cm:5
#The area of the square is: 25.0
